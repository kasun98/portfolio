									<h1>Falcon 9</h1>
									<p>Predicting Successful Landings to Optimize Rocket Launch Costs</p> <br>
									Reusing the first stage of Falcon 9 rockets significantly reduces the cost of space missions. While SpaceX advertises a launch cost of $62 million, other providers charge upwards of $165 million. The ability to predict successful landings of Falcon 9's first stage can provide invaluable insights for alternative companies competing against SpaceX. This project aims to develop a predictive model for the successful landing of Falcon 9's first stage, leveraging various data science methodologies and machine learning techniques.</p>

								<h2>THE CONCEPT</h2>
								<p>The project centers around building a robust machine learning model that predicts whether the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. This model helps in estimating the potential cost savings of a launch, thereby aiding competitors in bidding processes.</p>
								
								<h2>DATA COLLECTION AND PREPARATION</h2>
								<p>Data was gathered using a SpaceX REST API and web scraping techniques to compile detailed records of Falcon 9 launches. The data was then converted into a Pandas DataFrame and underwent extensive wrangling to clean and prepare it for analysis.</p>
								
								<h2>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS</h2>
								<p>Initial analysis involved creating scatter plots and bar charts to uncover patterns and insights. SQL queries were also executed to further manipulate and sort the data. This step was crucial in understanding the underlying factors that influence successful landings.</p>
								
								<h2>INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS</h2>
								<p>An interactive dashboard was developed using Plotly Dash, featuring pie charts and scatter plots to provide dynamic data analysis capabilities. Additionally, Folium was used to create an interactive map that visualized launch site proximities and calculated distances.</p>
								
								<h2>MACHINE LEARNING MODEL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
								<p>The core of the project involved training various classification models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Data was split into training and testing sets, and a hyperparameter grid search was conducted to optimize the models. The best-performing model was selected based on its performance on the test data.</p>

								<h2>DEVELOPMENT STACK</h2>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Pandas and SQL:</strong> For data manipulation and querying.</li>
										<li><strong>Plotly Dash:</strong> For creating interactive dashboards.</li>
										<li><strong>Folium:</strong> For generating interactive maps.</li>
										<li><strong>Scikit-Learn:</strong> For machine learning model development and evaluation.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								
								<h2>PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS</h2>
								<p>The final model was able to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage with high accuracy. This predictive capability not only helps in cost estimation but also provides strategic insights for companies looking to compete with SpaceX.</p>
								
								<h2>LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Data Quality:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data collected was a significant challenge.</li>
										<li><strong>Model Generalization:</strong> Making sure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data required careful validation and testing.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								
								<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
								<p>The Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction Project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing space mission costs. By accurately predicting the likelihood of successful landings, the project provides a strategic tool for competitive bidding and cost management in the aerospace industry. This project not only showcases the practical application of data science and machine learning but also highlights the significant cost benefits of reusable rocket technology.</p>
