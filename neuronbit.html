									<h1>Neuron Bit</h1>
									<p>An Innovative Approach to Predicting Bitcoin Market Direction</p><br>
									Predicting future prices in the volatile world of cryptocurrency has always been a challenging endeavor. Traditional models frequently rely on LSTM and RNN algorithms, employing techniques such as Z-score normalization and Min-Max normalization. However, these methods often fall short as they fail to adapt to the market’s breaking of previous minimums or maximums. Instead of predicting exact prices, I have developed a different approach through my project, NeuronBit, which aims to forecast the daily market direction of Bitcoin.

								<h2>The Concept</h2>
								<p>

									NeuronBit leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) with leaky ReLU activation and an intricate 14-layer architecture. Unlike conventional methods, NeuronBit predicts whether the next day's opening price will be higher or lower than today’s opening price. This directional prediction model provides traders with valuable insights into market trends, helping them make informed decisions.</p>

									<h2>
									Feature Engineering and Model Development</h2>
								<p>

									Feature engineering is the cornerstone of building an effective prediction model. For NeuronBit, I meticulously selected 26 features that significantly influence Bitcoin prices. These features were chosen based on their potential impact on market movements and their relevance to the prediction task. Notably, I chose not to apply normalization techniques, allowing the model to operate on raw data and adapt to market shifts more naturally.

									<h3>Development Stack</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Investpy API:</strong> For retrieving market data.</li>
										<li><strong>Plotly and Pandas:</strong> For data visualization and manipulation.</li>
										<li><strong>TensorFlow and Keras:</strong> For building and training the convolutional neural network.</li>
										<li><strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</strong> For creating an interactive user interface.</li>
										<li><strong>Flask:</strong> For serving the TensorFlow model to users via a web application.</li>
									</ul>

								<h2>Performance and Results</h2>
								<p>NeuronBit has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a 97% F1 score on the test dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the effectiveness of the feature selection and the robustness of the CNN architecture. Users can rely on NeuronBit to provide accurate market direction predictions, giving them a strategic edge in their trading activities.</p>

								<h2>Limitations and Challenges</h2>
								<p>Despite its impressive performance, NeuronBit does have some limitations:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>API Restrictions:</strong> The free API service used to fetch market data occasionally hits request limits, causing disruptions.</li>
									<li><strong>Weekday Suitability:</strong> The model is primarily designed for weekday trading and does not perform as well over weekends when market dynamics can differ significantly.</li>
								</ul>
						
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>NeuronBit represents a significant advancement in cryptocurrency market prediction. By focusing on market direction rather than exact prices and employing a CNN architecture without normalization, NeuronBit offers a fresh perspective on market forecasting. With its user-friendly web interface, traders can easily access reliable predictions and enhance their decision-making processes.</p>
